# UOCIS322 - Project 3 Luke Marshall

The purpose of this project is to introduce event-driven asynchrounous programming of a web application through the use of multiple langauges. The languages used in this project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. The HTML and CSS are used to produce the web page in tandem with Javascript. The Javascript is used through jQuery to produce a dynamic and event-driven web page. The Python is used through a Flask server to serve the web page and some of its functionality.
